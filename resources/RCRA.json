{"swagger":"2.0","info":{ "title":"U.S. EPA Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) - Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ","description":"Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) is a tool developed and maintained by EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance for public use. ECHO provides integrated compliance and enforcement information for about 800,000 regulated facilities nationwide.\n<BR><BR>RCRA Rest Services provides multiple service endpoints, each with specific capabilities, to search and retrieve data on hazardous waste handlers\/facilities regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).   The returned results reflect data drawn from EPA's RCRAInfo database.\n<BR><BR>\nThe get_facilities, get_map, get_qid, and get_download end points are meant to be used together, while the enhanced get_facility_info end point is self contained.\n  The get_facility_info end point returns either an array of state, county or zip clusters with summary statistics per cluster or an array of facilities.\n<BR><BR>\nThe recommended use scenario for get_facilities, get_qid, get_map, and get_downoad is:\n<br>\n<br><b>1)<\/b>  Use get_facilities to validate passed query parameters, obtain summary statistics and to obtain a query_id (QID).  QIDs are time sensitive and will be valid for approximately 30 minutes.\n<br><b>2)<\/b>  Use get_qid, with the returned QID, to paginate through arrays of facility results.\n<br><b>3)<\/b>  Use get_map, with the returned QID, to zoom in\/out and pan on the clustered and individual facility coordinates that meet the QID query criteria.\n<br><b>4)<\/b>  Use get_download, with the returned QID, to generate a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file of facility information that meets the QID query criteria.\n<br>\n<br>\nUse the qcolumns parameter to customize your search results.  Use the Metdata service endpoint for a list of available output objects, their Column Ids, and their definitions to help you build your customized output. \n<br><br>\nAdditional ECHO Resources:   <a href=\"https:\/\/echo.epa.gov\/tools\/web-services\">Web Services<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/echo.epa.gov\/resources\/echo-data\/about-the-data\">About ECHO's Data<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/echo.epa.gov\/tools\/data-downloads\">Data Downloads<\/a>\n<br>","contact":{ "name":"US EPA, OECA Integration, Targeting and Access Branch"},"license":{ "name":"This page was built with the Swagger API.","url":"https:\/\/swagger.io"},"version":"0.0.0"},"host":"ofmpub.epa.gov","basePath":"\/echo","schemes":[ "https"],"consumes":[ "application\/x-www-form-urlencoded"],"produces":[ "application\/json","application\/xml"],"parameters":{"f.p_med": { "name":"p_med","in":"formData","description":"Filter Results by Media.\n- A = Air\n- M = RMP (Risk Management Plan)\n- R = RCRA (Hazardous Waste)\n- S = SDWA (Public Drinking Water Systems)\n- W = Water\n- ALL = Air and Water and RCRA","enum":[ "A","M","R","S","W","ALL"],"type":"string","required":false},"q.p_med": { "name":"p_med","in":"query","description":"Filter Results by Media.\n- A = Air\n- M = RMP (Risk Management Plan)\n- R = RCRA (Hazardous Waste)\n- S = SDWA (Public Drinking Water Systems)\n- W = Water\n- ALL = Air and Water and RCRA","enum":[ "A","M","R","S","W","ALL"],"type":"string","required":false},"q.p_id": { "name":"p_id","in":"query","description":"Identifier for the service.","type":"string","required":true},"f.p_id": { "name":"p_id","in":"formData","description":"Identifier for the service.","type":"string","required":true},"q.p_fn": { "name":"p_fn","in":"query","description":"Facility Name Filter.
