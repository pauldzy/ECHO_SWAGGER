Data of interest from other EPA sources, \nsuch as the Toxics Release Inventory, is also supplied for context.\n<BR><BR>\nThe get_facilities, get_map, get_qid, and get_download end points are meant to be used together, while the enhanced get_facility_info end point is self contained.\n  The get_facility_info end point returns either an array of state, county or zip clusters with summary statistics per cluster or an array of facilities.\n<BR><BR>\nThe recommended use scenario for get_facilities, get_qid, get_map, and get_downoad is:\n<br>\n<br><b>1)<\/b>  Use get_facilities to validate passed query parameters, obtain summary statistics and to obtain a query_id (QID).  QIDs are time sensitive and will be valid for approximately 30 minutes.\n<br><b>2)<\/b>  Use get_qid, with the returned QID, to paginate through arrays of facility results.\n<br><b>3)<\/b>  Use get_map, with the returned QID, to zoom in\/out and pan on the clustered and individual facility coordinates that meet the QID query criteria.\n<br><b>4)<\/b>  Use get_download, with the returned QID, to generate a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file of facility information that meets the QID query criteria.\n<br>\n<br>\nUse the qcolumns parameter to customize your search results.  Use the Metdata service endpoint for a list of available output objects, their Column Ids, and their definitions to help you build your customized output. \n<br><br>\nAdditional ECHO Resources:   <a href=\"https:\/\/echo.epa.gov\/tools\/web-services\">Web Services<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/echo.epa.gov\/resources\/echo-data\/about-the-data\">About ECHO's Data<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/echo.epa.gov\/tools\/data-downloads\">Data Downloads<\/a>\n<br>","contact":{ "name":"US EPA, OECA Integration, Targeting and Access Branch"},"license":{ "name":"This page was built with the Swagger API.","url":"https:\/\/swagger.io"},"version":"1.0.0"},"host":"ofmpub.epa.gov","basePath":"\/echo","schemes":[ "https"],"consumes":[ "application\/x-www-form-urlencoded"],"produces":[ "application\/json","application\/xml"],"parameters":{"q.p_naa": { "name":"p_naa","in":"query","description":"Non-Attainment Area Flag.

The database includes estimates of annual emissions, by source, of air pollutants in each area of the country, on an annual basis.\n- TSCA: Toxic Substances Control Act addressing the production, importation, use, and disposal of specific chemicals."},"HUC8":{"type":"string"},"HUC8Name":{"type":"string"},"WBD12":{"type":"string","title":"Watershed Boundary Dataset Level 12 Code"},"WBD12Name":{"type":"string","title":"Watershed Boundary Dataset Level 12 Name"},"ReceivingWaters":{"type":"string","title":"Receiving Waters","description":"The name of the river, lake, stream, or estuary that receives runoff from the facility."},"ImpairedWaters":{"type":"string","title":"Impaired Waters","description":"Field indicates if the permit discharges directly into category 4 or 5 impaired waters."},"CSS":{"type":"string"},"RadGnisName":{"type":"string","title":"Reach Address Database GNIS Name","example":"Pojoaque River","description":"The name of the waterbody from the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) database in which the facility is permitted to discharge directly."},"RadReachcode":{"type":"string","title":"Reach Address Database Reach Code","example":"144957244039","description":"A nationally unique and permanent identifier for the waterbody, assigned by the US Geological Survey."},"CWPCsoOutfalls":{"type":"string","title":"CSO Outfalls","example":"59","description":"The number of discharge outfalls at points prior to the treatment plant."},"AttainsAuCategory":{"type":"string","title":"ATTAINS Assessment Unit Category","example":"5","description":"The impairment class or category of the waterbody in which the facility is permitted to discharge directly.
