Data of interest from other EPA sources, \nsuch as the Toxics Release Inventory, is also supplied for context.\n<BR><BR>\nThe get_facilities, get_map, get_qid, and get_download end points are meant to be used together, while the enhanced get_facility_info end point is self contained.\n  The get_facility_info end point returns either an array of state, county or zip clusters with summary statistics per cluster or an array of facilities.\n<BR><BR>\nThe recommended use scenario for get_facilities, get_qid, get_map, and get_downoad is:\n<br>\n<br><b>1)<\/b>&nbsp Use get_facilities to validate passed query parameters, obtain summary statistics and to obtain a query_id (QID).  QIDs are time sensitive and will be valid for approximately 30 minutes.\n<br><b>2)<\/b>&nbsp Use get_qid, with the returned QID, to paginate through arrays of facility results.\n<br><b>3)<\/b>&nbsp Use get_map, with the returned QID, to zoom in\/out and pan on the clustered and individual facility coordinates that meet the QID query criteria.\n<br><b>4)<\/b>&nbsp Use get_download, with the returned QID, to generate a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file of facility information that meets the QID query criteria.\n<br>\n<br>\nUse the qcolumns parameter to customize your search results.
