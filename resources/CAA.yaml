  title: U.S. EPA Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) - Air Pollutant Report Rest Services
  description: |-
    Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) is a tool developed and maintained by EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance for public use. ECHO provides integrated compliance and enforcement information for over 1 million regulated facilities nationwide. The Air Pollutant Report presents ten years of EPA air emissions data from the National Emissions Inventory (NEI), Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP), Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), and Clean Air Markets Programs for a selected facility. Emissions are presented by pollutant for each program and each year that values are available.

Under the CAA, federally reportable sources include majors, synthetic minors, NESHAP Part 61 minors, minors with an unresolved High Priority Violation (HPV), with recent enforcement actions, or included on a Compliance Monitoring Strategy plan. The Clean Air Act requires that delegated agencies and EPA track all federally reportable sources in Air Facility System (AFS).
          - For CWA  = Each CWA Source ID or National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit is defined by the program office as a Major or Minor discharger.
          - For RCRA = RCRA Source ID or permits for Treatment, Storage and Disposal facilities are identified by TSD, Large Quantity Generators are identified by LQG.

Under the CWA, all facilities discharging pollutants from a point source (e.g., a pipe) to surface waters must have a NPDES permit. For CWA, ICISNPDES designates a permit as Effective, Administratively Continued, Expired, Not Needed, Pending, Retired, or Terminated. RCRA facilities (sites) are designated as Active or Inactive.
