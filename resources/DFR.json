ECHO provides integrated compliance and enforcement information for over 1 million regulated facilities nationwide.\n\nDFR Rest Services provide multiple service endpoints, to retrieve detailed facility location, enforcement, compliance monitoring, and pollutant information for any single facility.  See the Detailed Facility Report (DFR) Help Page (https:\/\/echo.epa.gov\/help\/reports\/detailed-facility-report-help) for additional information on the DFR.  Additionally, a Data Dictionary (https:\/\/echo.epa.gov\/help\/reports\/dfr-data-dictionary) is also available. \nThere is one primary service end point, get_dfr, that provides all available DFR data.  All other service end points that are exposed, will return data on a single section of the DFR.    \n \nAdditional ECHO Resources:   <a href=\"https:\/\/echo.epa.gov\/tools\/web-services\">Web Services<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/echo.epa.gov\/resources\/echo-data\/about-the-data\">About ECHO's Data<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/echo.epa.gov\/tools\/data-downloads\">Data Downloads<\/a>\n ","contact":{ "name":"US EPA, OECA Integration, Targeting and Access Branch"},"license":{ "name":"This page was built with the Swagger API.","url":"https:\/\/swagger.io"},"version":"0.0.0"},"host":"echodata.epa.gov","basePath":"\/echo","schemes":[ "https"],"consumes":[ "application\/x-www-form-urlencoded"],"produces":[ "application\/json","application\/xml"],"parameters":{"q.output": { "name":"output","in":"query","description":"Output Format Flag.
